# Introduction

Welcome to Awesome Web Apps with Angular!

If you've heard about Angular and maybe even tried it out and are ready to get serious, you've come to the right place. This Path combines material from the official Angular Developer Guide and adds in flavor from blog posts written by independent developer authors. If you are totally new to Angular, you may want to start with [Angular Tutorial](https://www.outlearn.com/learn/vkarpov15/angular-crash-course/7).

We'll start with 10 reasons to learn Angular. After talking about how awesome Angular is, we'll follow up with an overview of what Angular is good at and how it works. Next, you'll find a blog post about things one experienced author wished someone would have told him before he started working in Angular. That is followed by Modules on different Angular concepts.

As you go through the path, you can track your progress and put your learning to practice with tasks that are included in the Modules.

If you have any feedback, go ahead and use the Feedback bar on the right.

Hope you enjoy the ride!
